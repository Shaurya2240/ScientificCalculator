# ScientificCalculator
A "Scientific Calculator " is a programming project that utilizes the C++ language to create a console-based application mimicking the functionality of a standard scientific calculator, enabling users to perform not only basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) but also advanced mathematical functions like trigonometric calculations (sine, cosine, tangent), exponentiation, logarithms, and more, all through user input via the command line.

Key Features:
Trigonometric Functions: Sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), inverse trigonometric functions (arcsin, arccos, arctan).
Logarithmic Functions: Natural logarithm (ln), base-10 logarithm (log).
Exponential Functions: Exponentiation (x^y).
Other Functions: Factorial calculation, square root, power calculations.

Project Structure:
Input Handling: The program prompts the user to enter numbers and the desired operation using a menu or clear input format.
Function Implementation: Separate functions are designed for each mathematical operation, including error handling for invalid inputs.
User Interface: A simple text-based menu is presented to guide user interaction.
